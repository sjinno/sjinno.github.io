title = "24 Days of Rust: Intro"

I have been playing with Rust sporadically here and there since three months ago, but I feel like I actually haven't learned the language deeper enough. So, I am going to challenge myself for the next 24 days to finally dive a little deeper into what Rust has to offer.

In the next 24 days, I would like to explore the following topics:

- Owenership
- Enums
- Error handling
- Traits
- Rc
- RefCell
- Arc
- Concurrency
- PostgreSQL in Rust
- WebSocket
- I/O
- Iterators
- Closures
- Macros
- Structure literals
- Serialization
- Use of `reqwest` with and w/o Tokio runtime
- Linear algebra with `nalgebra`,

and more.

There is so much stuff I still don't know about not only Rust programming language iteself, but computer/technology related stuff in general. And it's always better late than never. üê≥

So, without further ado, I'll let myself get started. üòÖ

**P.S.** The order of the challenges will be random, and I will keep updating the list as I come up with more stuff I want to explore.
