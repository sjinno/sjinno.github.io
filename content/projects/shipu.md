**Description:** This is an **offline recipe maker** by scraping the data of your favorite recipes from Cookpad JP and save it into its own html file. Useful if you have bad internet or are extremely tired of having to access to the website everytime you need it.

**Languages:** Rust and Python + HTML/CSS

**Note:** [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/v0.13.2/) is used in order to run Rust from Python.
