**Description:**

Similar to [Snake](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)>), this is a CLI game that you (player) and a mouse (computer) keep going after cheese and whoever reaches 10 cheeses first wins.

The mouse uses an orthodox BFS to find the shortest path to search for cheese. I might replace the searching algorithm with A\* sometime.

**Languages:** Rust

**Libraries:** rand, termion
